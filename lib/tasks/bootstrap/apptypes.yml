#   Change/Development History:
#   2.1  7-July-2008
#    * downloaded production data from ThatBottle Beta 1B on 6 July 2008 using phpMyAdmin YAML export function
#    * adjusted (country_id:) entries to reflect changes to countries table
#    * compacted (id:) entries to remove gaps
#    *  -> also affects (nexthigher_id:)
#    * checked for bad formatting (tabs)
#    * moderate to significant impact on appellations table - change that using SQL, not editing YAML file.
#   2.2  9-July-2008
#    * fixed some data: translation and fullname blank or transposed for a few appellation types.
