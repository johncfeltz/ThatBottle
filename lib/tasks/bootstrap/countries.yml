  isocode_num: 250
  name: France
  notes: Probably the most respected producer of wines in the world, although quality can vary, and value is often lacking in comparison to southern hemisphere producers.

  isocode_num: 276
  name: Germany
  notes: Noted for sweet and off-dry whites from the Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Gris grapes.  Quality can be highly variable, and the naming and labelling rules are difficult to understand.  German producers are notorious for over-use of sulfites, which can often be detected on the nose in cheaper bottles.

  isocode_num: 380
  name: Italy
  notes: Prolific producer and consumer of wine; no country has a more ingrained wine culture at the everyday level than Italy.  Fine reds are produced in the north (Chianti, Barolo, Barbaresco), while fruitier reds and whites are produced in the south, especially Sicily.

  isocode_num: 036
  name: Australia
  notes: Australian wine law in its current form, with Geographical Indications similar to (but not as strict as) European appellations, was enacted in 1993.  GIs can be zones, regions, or sub-regions, in increasing order of specificity.

  name: South Africa
  notes: Often exhibits an interesting mix of old-world and new-world techniques and flavors.  The Pinotage hybrid (created in the 1920s from Pinot Noir and Cinsault) is the signature grape of South Africa.

  isocode_num: 152
  name: Chile
  notes: Rapidly increasing in quality, with a number of investments from international winemakers - most notably the Rothschild family's Escudo Rojo brand.  Concha y Toro is the largest domestic producer.  The Carmenere grape, formerly a minor blending grape in Bordeaux before the 19th century phylloxera epidemic, was rediscovered in Chile in the late 1990s and has become a signature grape for the country.

  isocode_num: 724
  name: Spain
  notes: Spain has the largest area under cultivation in the wine-growing world.  But it produces less wine than France or Italy, due to the low level of groundwater which forces widely-spaced vines.  The Rioja and Ribera del Duero regions are the most renowned for powerful, long-lived red wines.  Key aging terms for Spanish wines (the time periods given are for DOC Rioja and DO Ribera del Duero -- other DOs/DOCs have varying requirements for barrel and bottle aging); Joven - a young wine with little or no barrel aging; Crianza - minimum of 1 year in barrel, 2 years overall; Reserva - minimum of 1 year in barrel, 3 years overall; Gran Reserva - minimum of 2 years in barrel, 5 years overall.

  name: Greece
  notes: Greece has a bewildering variety of native grapes, which are still poorly catalogued and understood.  Retsina, the resin-flavored cafe wine, is best known to the casual tourist, but a number of fine crisp whites are being produced with more attention paid to freshness and refrigeration.
