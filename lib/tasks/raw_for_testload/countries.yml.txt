  name: Germany
  notes: Noted for sweet and off-dry whites from the Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Gris grapes.  Quality can be highly variable, and the naming and labelling rules are difficult to understand.  
German producers are notorious for over-use of sulfites, which can often be detected on the nose in cheaper bottles.

  notes: Rapidly increasing in quality, with a number of investments from international winemakers - most notably the Rothschild family's Escudo Rojo brand.  Concha y Toro is the largest domestic producer.  The Carmenere grape, formerly a minor blending grape in Bordeaux before the 19th century phylloxera epidemic, was rediscovered in Chile in the late 1990s and has become a signature grape for the country.

  name: Spain
  notes: Spain has the largest area under cultivation in the wine-growing world.  But it produces less wine than France or Italy, due to the low level of groundwater which forces widely-spaced vines.  The Rioja and Ribera del Duero regions are the most renowned for powerful, long-lived red wines.
Key aging terms for Spanish wines (the time periods given are for DOC Rioja and DO Ribera del Duero -- other DOs/DOCs have varying requirements for barrel and bottle aging).
Joven: a young wine with little or no barrel aging.
Crianza: minimum of 1 year in barrel, 2 years overall.
Reserva: minimum of 1 year in barrel, 3 years overall.
Gran Reserva: minimum of 2 years in barrel, 5 years overall.

  notes: Greece has a bewildering variety of native grapes, which are still poorly catalogued and understood.  Retsina, the resin-flavored cafe wine, is best known to the casual tourist, but a number of fine crisp whites are being produced with more attention paid to freshness and refrigeration.
